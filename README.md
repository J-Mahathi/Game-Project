# This is a Simon Says Game

(This game is similar to the word/letter chaining game that we used to play in childhood.)
The game consists of four colored boxes. The game begins when the user presses any random key, and then the user needs to follow the sequence of the colored boxes generated by the computer.

As the user correctly repeats the sequences, the game level increases, making the sequence longer and more challenging.
The game ends when the user mismatches the sequence. At that point, the final score is displayed, along with the highest score achieved so far.
